# 131_TOPIC_case_insensitive_channel.spec
# Tests RFC 2812 case-insensitivity of channel names during TOPIC query
# Expected: Server normalizes channel name and returns topic for #mychannel when queried as #MYCHANNEL.
# Bug: Server stores channels in case-sensitive Map and returns 403 #MYCHANNEL :No such channel.
