# 139_PART_multi_channel_batch.spec
# Tests RFC 2812 §3.2.2 multi-channel batch parting syntax: PART #chan1,#chan2 [<Part Message>]
# Expected: Client parts both #chan1 and #chan2, broadcasting PART notifications on both channels.
# Bug: Server treats '#chan1,#chan2' as a single literal channel name instead of splitting by comma, returning 403.
