# 50_MODE_ghost_operator_fd_reuse.spec
# Tests security vulnerability: FD recycling ghost operator privilege leak when modifying modes
# Expected: A newly connected client who receives a recycled socket FD is NOT an operator and cannot execute MODE #optest +i.
# Bug: disconnect_client fails to clear operator_fds. A new user with recycled FD automatically becomes channel operator on JOIN and can change modes.
