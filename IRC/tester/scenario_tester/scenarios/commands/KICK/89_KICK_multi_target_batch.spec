# 89_KICK_multi_target_batch.spec
# Tests RFC 2812 §3.2.8 comma-separated multi-user batch kick (KICK #lobby89K Bob,Charlie :batch).
# Expected: Server parses the comma-separated user list, kicking both Bob and Charlie.
# Bug: Server treats 'Bob,Charlie' as a single literal nickname, searching for client 'Bob,Charlie' and failing with 401 ERR_NOSUCHNICK.
